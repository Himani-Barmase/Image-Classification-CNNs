# Image-Classification-CNNs
This repository contains a complete implementation of an image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The objective is to build, train, evaluate, and improve a CNN model to classify images into 10 distinct categories.
